# 🌐 **CDOE** 🌐

This program is _written in C_ and allows you to calculate the distance between the coordinates of objects on the Earth's surface. _All coordinates are decimal degrees_ ❗ **WITHOUT MINUTES AND SECONDS** ❗  

>During the writing of the program, standard C header files were used, and my own header file was also written, which simplified the development of the program. My header file defines the constants used in the program code, and they are presented as hexadecimal numbers, because I like them. Also, for windows users there is a start screensaver with a melody <3

💾 Building with GCC:

```shell

gcc  main.c  intro.c  calc_dist.c  world_side.c

```
